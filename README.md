# Alarm Interaction Technique Study

A user study interface comparing radial clock-wheel navigation vs. standard vertical scroll for iOS alarm management.

## Research Question

How does the interaction technique (standard vertical Scroll list vs. Radial Clock-Wheel filter), list length, and target alarm position affect task completion time, perceived mental effort, and error rate when turning off a specific alarm?

## Study Design

**Target Population:** University students and working young adults aged 18–30 who use smartphone alarms daily.

**Task:** Locate and turn off a specific highlighted alarm as quickly and accurately as possible.

**Measures:**
- Primary: Task completion time (seconds)
- Secondary: Perceived mental effort (NASA-TLX 0–100)
- Exploratory: Error rate (%)

## Design Rationale

The standard iOS alarm list requires repetitive scrolling to access alarms within extensive lists, imposing unnecessary cognitive and physical effort. This radial clock-wheel technique addresses navigation inefficiency by utilizing a spatial metaphor—users can locate alarms through a single gesture that reflects their mental model of time.
